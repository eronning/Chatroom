description:

you can run the project with 'node server.js'.

sockets are used to generate realtime interactions
for a chatroom. people can join a room and send messages
to other people in that room. people are capable of seeing 
the list of people in the room and are capable of changing their
nickname. 

each room is unique and will not be duplicated.

whenever a person changes their nickname, all the corresponding 
messages stored in the db for that person will be updated to 
match the new nickname.

info:

comments such as information about people joining/leaving
the room or people changing nicknames is not stored in the
db, which means that on a message refresh they will disappear.

message refresh will generally occur when a nickname is changed
or it will occur for a person when they first join the room.

known Bugs:

nicknames for each room are not checked for uniqueness,
meaning that if two of the same nickname is in the same
room then they will be treated as the same person.
